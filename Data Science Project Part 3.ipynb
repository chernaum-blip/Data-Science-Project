    "Section 1\n",
    "1.a. The authors grew single-strain and mixed bacterial cultures of E. coli strains that had been genetically transformed to carry different antibiotic resistance markers. These genetic differences allowed them to distinguish competing populations during coculture using red or green fluorescent proteins. The growth of each well was monitored automatically using a plate reader, which recorded optical density (OD), OD595, over time to estimate cell population density. This dataset was ideal for testing the authors’ hypothesis because OD measurements directly reflect microbial growth rate and carrying capacity, the two key variables needed for modeling population dynamics. The researchers grew E. coli in both single-strain cultures, where each well contained only one genetically distinct strain, and mixed cultures, where two strains were combined in the same well. This design allowed them to compare growth under both isolation and competition conditions, providing direct data for modeling microbial interactions. The fluorescence data for the individual strains while in mixed culture was reported in two separate tables included with the main dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The features are the time of each observation, the temperature, the strain of each well, the color of each well (green or red), and the well labels for a total of 99 features. The time tells when the observation was taken during the microbial growth, the temperature shows the cells are growing under proper conditions, the strain indicates the type of cell growing in the wells, the color indicates the relative population of both strains during mixed growth, and the 95 well labels indicate where the observation is taken. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the main dataset there are 6,365 observations. Each observation corresponds to a single well at a single time point, where the optical density (OD) of the culture was measured. Each well contained either a single strain or a pair of strains (in mixed conditions), and OD was recorded repeatedly over time to capture growth curves. This means the total number of observations equals the number of wells multiplied by the number of times measured. Two other tables are included in the file with the main data set to identify individual strain growth in the mixed culture. These tables have the same observations and features, but they do not include the strain and color features as a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.b. The data set collected with the Tecan microplate reader provides detailed, time-resolved measurements of OD and fluorescence intensity for microbial cultures growing under controlled conditions. Each well on the 96-well plate contains a different strain or experimental condition, and the instrument records OD values at regular time intervals, producing complete growth curves for each strain. \n",
    "\n",
    "This information is directly related to the paper’s research goal, which was to determine whether growth in mixed microbial cultures can be predicted from the individual growth dynamics of each strain measured in isolation. The Tecan data captures how quickly each strain grows, how long it takes to reach saturation, and what its maximum density is. These parameters are essential inputs for mathematical models that describe microbial competition and predict relative fitness in mixed environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "A research question that can be asked is how does the relative abundance of two E. coli strains change over time in mixed culture compared to their individual growth rates in isolation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Section 2\n",
    "2.a. The data came from figshare and a zip containing the strain and color data and the main data were downloaded as Excel files. The optical density tables for the mixed and isolated cultures all have data for the 96-well plates. These tables have 97 rows and 69 features. The rows have the well label, temperature and time for the observations. The columns are the cycle number referring to the individual instances of measurement. Strain and color were stored in a different Excel file which the data can be copied and pasted to the main data file to act as a form of concatenation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is stored in an Excel format, organized as a grid of rows and columns, where each cell contains one optical density (OD) value, the other two tables have the same format but the values are for fluorescence intensity. Because the file is an Excel spreadsheet, there are no delimiters used.\n",

    "![Figure 1: Growth Curves for Mixed Cultures](Fig1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1 was created from single-strain growth data obtained using a Tecan microplate reader, the same type of data found in the dataset. Panel A plots mean cell density (OD) on the y-axis against time (hours) on the x-axis. The open circles represent measured OD values across replicates. The solid black line is a polynomial fit used to smooth experimental data. The dashed line shows an exponential model fit, representing the theoretical exponential growth phase. Panel B plots the growth rate (dN/dt ÷ N) on the y-axis against time (hours) on the x-axis, calculated by differentiating the fitted curve from Panel A. The peak growth rate corresponds to the time of maximum exponential growth, tₘₐₓ. This analysis was done by taking the logarithm of OD values and performing a linear regression during the exponential phase to estimate the growth rate (r). \n",
    "\n",
    "The authors included this figure to show the step-by-step approach they used to analyze their experimental growth data. It demonstrates how OD readings were turned into measurable biological values (growth rate, lag time, and carrying capacity) that were later used in the mixed-culture competition models. Overall, this figure lays out the data-analysis method that supports the predictive modeling in later figures. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can conclude that the exponential model fits well during the early and mid-log phases of growth but diverges slightly as the culture approaches saturation. Also, the growth-rate curve (Panel B) confirms that microbial growth follows a predictable pattern, with a rapid increase to a peak rate followed by a gradual slowdown. Finally, these results show that the exponential model works well for describing microbial growth in its active phase, giving reliable parameters for later prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 1: Growth Curves for Mixed Cultures](Fig4.png)\n",
    "Figure 4 was created by plotting optical density (OD) on the y-axis against time (hours) on the x-axis. Each blue curve represents a different mixed-culture condition, where two E. coli strains were grown together in the same well. The individual data points represent the mean OD of replicate wells at each time point, showing how population density changes over the course of the experiment. The dashed black line represents the predicted total density fitted to an exponential model equation based on the data collected from monoculture growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors included this figure to visually compare the observed mixed-culture growth (solid blue lines) with the model predictions (black dotted line) based on single-strain data. This allows them to directly test the central hypothesis: “Can growth in mixed cultures be accurately predicted from single-strain growth curves?”\n",
    "\n",
    "This visualization shows the reader how well the model can predict growth curves of the mixed culture. The measured blue points represent the real data and mostly follow the solid model lines, showing good agreement between observed and predicted growth. However, the dashed black line, representing a simple exponential model formulated from data of single strain monocultures, overestimates the total density. This means the strains do not grow entirely independently when in a mixed culture, they likely compete for resources, slowing each other’s growth in mixed culture.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 1: Growth Curves for Mixed Cultures](Table1.png)\n",
    "I created a summary table that combines data from the mixed-culture OD readings with the red and green fluorescence data. For each well, the table lists the maximum optical density (total population growth), the time at which OD reached its maximum value, and the maximum fluorescence intensity for both red and green channels. These values were obtained by identifying the highest OD and fluorescence readings recorded for each well l throughout the experiment. Time to saturation represents the cycle number or corresponding time point when the culture reached its maximum density. The “Dominant Strain” column was determined by comparing the red and green fluorescence intensities, with the higher value indicating which strain became more abundant in the mixed culture.\n",
    "\n",
    "This table provides a concise overview of how total population growth (OD) relates to the relative success of each strain (fluorescence). It shows that some wells exhibit green-strain dominance without reducing overall growth, whereas others show red-strain dominance accompanied by lower maximum OD. By integrating OD and fluorescence data, this table reveals how competitive interactions between strains shape both the total yield and final composition of the mixed culture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Section 4\n",
    "The feedback was addressed about the description of how the data was collected. I made clear what, why and how the data was created in the revised response. The original response more focused on the why of the experiment. The feedback about the data related to the absence of descriptors for what each wells strain and color were. Using the extra file in the zip folder downloaded this data was then added to the end of the table for OD values making it one table having all features and observations present.\n"

    "In this revised version of project part 2, I clarified how the data were collected by explaining that the E. coli strains were genetically engineered to express red or green fluorescent proteins, which allowed the researchers to distinguish between them during coculture. I improved the feature description by specifying that the dataset includes time, temperature, strain identity, fluorescence color, and well labels, and that the red and green fluorescence tables contain strain-specific data complementary to the OD measurements. I also connected Figure 4 more clearly to the dataset by explaining that it represents the relationship between replicates and demonstrates how the data better fits an improved mixed-culture model compared to single-strain models. To strengthen the analysis, I created a new summary table that combines OD, red, and green fluorescence data for each well, calculating the maximum OD, time to saturation, and dominant strain based on fluorescence intensity. This table provides a clearer comparison of total culture growth and strain competition, illustrating how both measurements relate to population dynamics."

    "These files together provide both the quantitative growth data and the metadata describing which strain is present in each well.\n",
    "For this project, the Yoav_060116 file was opened in Excel and saved as Data science project Data.xlsx in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook, ensuring the analysis code runs without changing the file paths. The plate data file was then opened, and the strain and color columns were copied into the main dataset. These two columns were pasted immediately after the first column, and their data were shifted down by two cells to align correctly with the wells they represent. This step integrated the plate layout information with the optical density data, allowing each well’s strain identity and culture type (mixed or monoculture) to be associated with its OD and fluorescence measurements."

This was written in the code to call Sheet10 only from the excel file. Using pandas the code is specifying different starting rows with skiprows and limiting columns to 'A:BP' to include only relevant data. The index_col=0 argument sets the well IDs cycle number and temp column as the index for all three tables. Column names are cleaned to remove hidden spaces, and the first few rows are displayed to confirm successful loading."

The numerical description of the data confirms this structure, showing 97 rows by 69 columns. However, when summarizing the dataset using descriptive statistics, the non-numerical columns (strain and color) are excluded, as they contain categorical rather than continuous data. The describe function was then applied to the numerical columns to summarize central tendencies and variation in OD measurements across all wells."

I also expect the mean OD at this early time point to be relatively low compared to later cycles, because the cultures have had less time to grow. The minimum should be close to the starting OD, while the maximum and upper quartiles should still be well below the saturation level, resulting in a moderate standard deviation that reflects some variation in early growth between wells."

These two non-well rows inflated the count from 95 to 97 and slightly distorted the summary statistics. To fix this, I restricted the describe calculation to only the well rows by using .iloc[2:], so that the output reflects OD values for the 95 wells only and matches the structure of the observations I intended to analyze."

When applying the describe function to well B8, I would expect the count to be 67, since there should be one OD measurement for this well at each cycle. I also expect the minimum OD to be close to the starting value at the beginning of the experiment, and the maximum to be near the carrying capacity the culture reaches at its peak. The mean OD for B8 should fall somewhere between these two, reflecting the fact that the well spends part of the experiment in early growth and part in later, higher-density phases. The standard deviation should be fairly large, because OD changes substantially over time within a single well as the culture grows and levels off."

    "When I ran the describe function on well B8 across all cycles, the output did not look like a numeric summary with a mean and standard deviation as I expected. Instead, it returned count, unique, top, and freq, which are the summary statistics pandas uses for non-numeric (categorical) data. The count value of 69 corresponds to the number of cycle columns included for B8 and factored in the two values from strain and color. The unique value of 64 indicates that there are 64 distinct OD values observed across those cycles. The top value of 0.711 with a freq of 2 means that 0.711 is the OD value that appears most often for B8, and it occurs twice. This happened because pandas interpreted the OD values for B8 as non-numeric rather than continuous numeric data, so it summarized them as categories instead of computing a mean and standard deviation. Even though this is not the ideal numeric description, it still shows that most OD values are different across time and that only a small number of values repeat. Overall, these two examples show that while the dataset is mostly complete and consistent, care is needed when interpreting describe outputs, especially when metadata rows or non-numeric types are mixed into the table."

Plotting OD on the y-axis and well ID on the x-axis lets us quickly see whether most wells have similar OD or whether there are large differences or outliers at this early point in the experiment."

    "The scatterplot shows that most wells have OD values between roughly 0.63 and 0.75, with a few wells noticeably lower (including one near 0.45 and one close to 0.10). This agrees with the describe output from 3.2, which reported a mean OD ≈ 0.675, std ≈ 0.082, a minimum of 0.10, and a maximum of 0.77 for cycle 10. The tight vertical band of points around the mean and the presence of a small number of low outliers visually confirm the numerical summary: most wells are already at fairly high density at cycle 10, but a few lag behind.\n",
    "\n",
    "This visualization relates to the paper’s hypothesis about predicting mixed-culture growth from growth-curve data because it illustrates how similar many wells are at a given time point, despite being different strain or culture-type combinations. The fact that OD at cycle 10 is already high and relatively consistent across wells supports the idea that growth follows a predictable pattern that can be captured by simple models, as in the figures where the authors fit growth curves and competition models to OD data over time."

    "For this second feature I made a scatterplot of OD vs. cycle number for well B8. This is appropriate because we’re now looking at how a single culture changes over time, so cycle number plays the role of a time axis and each point is one measurement of OD in that well. A scatterplot lets us see the overall trend in B8’s growth curve—whether OD is rising, flat, or declining across the 67 cycles—and whether there is much noise or any sudden jumps that might indicate measurement issues."

    "The scatterplot shows that OD in red well B8 starts fairly high (around 0.71) and then gradually declines to about 0.65 across the experiment, forming a downward trend rather than the classic sigmoidal growth curve. This does not match the behavior we would expect if we were seeing the full growth phase; instead, it looks like B8 is already near carrying capacity or even in a slight decline when the recorded cycles begin. In 3.2, when I tried to apply describe() to B8, pandas treated the values as categorical and returned count, unique, top, and freq instead of numeric statistics, so that summary was not very informative. The scatterplot exposes the actual numeric pattern and makes it clear that B8’s OD is not increasing over time.\n",
    "This example is important because it does not strongly support the authors’ hypothesis on its own. The paper’s central idea is that mixed-culture growth can be predicted from single-strain growth curves, but the odd behavior of a single red-strain well like B8 (already high and slowly declining) would be misleading if taken in isolation. Instead, it highlights the importance of having many replicate wells and analyzing patterns across them rather than relying on one example. The authors’ models are fit to average behavior and many replicates, which smooth out wells like B8 that may be in a slightly different phase or affected by noise. This well is a good reminder that individual trajectories can deviate from the “typical” growth curve, and that robust predictions depend on replicates and summary statistics, not single outlier wells.\n"

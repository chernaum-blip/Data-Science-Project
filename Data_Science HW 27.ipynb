In a group project, GitHub lets multiple people work on the same code base at the same time. This allows the group to collaborate and see who is putting what in the code so if claity is needed the author can be asked to explain.

Employers use GitHub to see real examples of a candidate’s code, projects, and problem-solving skills. It shows not only what languages and tools they use, but also how they organize projects, write documentation, and improve their work over time.

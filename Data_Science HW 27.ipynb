    "1. GitHub is a website where code can be posted to an online workspace. This way someone can access the files whenever or wherever, as long as they have internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Version control is a system that keeps track of changes to files over time, a form of good documentation practice. All work and previous versions can be reverted to in case a code gets messed up.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In a group project, GitHub lets multiple people work on the same code base at the same time. This allows the group to collaborate and see who is putting what in the code so if claity is needed the author can be asked to explain.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Employers use GitHub to see real examples of a candidate’s code, projects, and problem-solving skills. It shows not only what languages and tools they use, but also how they organize projects, write documentation, and improve their work over time.\n"
